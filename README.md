*A research-oriented, fully offline conversational AI system for immersive games*

## Project Motivation

Modern games still rely on **static dialogue trees** or cloud-based AI services for NPC interaction.  
This project demonstrates that **domain-trained, lightweight Transformer models** can enable **real-time, voice-driven NPC conversations entirely offline**, achieving low latency, strong semantic coherence, and lore consistency.

**Sentient_NPC** bridges **AI research** and **game engineering**, making it relevant for:
- Applied Machine Learning / Natural Language Processing roles
- Game AI and simulation research
- Edge AI and on-device inference
- Speech and language systems

---

## Key Contributions

- Designed a **fully offline STT → NLP → TTS pipeline**
- Built a **custom Transformer dialogue model (~2.6M parameters)**
- Trained on **7,565 Skyrim-style NPC–Player dialogue pairs**
- Achieved **BERTScore-F1 ~ 0.90** with **sub-300 ms inference** *(excluding TTS playback)*
- Released the **full training notebook (`training.ipynb`)** for reproducibility

## Model Overview

- **Architecture:** Encoder–Decoder Transformer  
- **Attention:** Multi-head self-attention + cross-attention  
- **Training:** Teacher forcing with masked loss  
- **Optimizer:** AdamW + warmup cosine decay  
- **Precision:** Mixed precision supported  
- **Inference:** Greedy decoding + Top-k sampling  

**Model Size:** ~30 MB  
**Chatbot Latency:** ~245 ms

## Experimental Results

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Score |
|------|------|
| BLEU | 0.178 |
| ROUGE-L | 0.539 |
| METEOR | 0.424 |
| **BERTScore-F1** | **0.904** |

The compact domain-trained Transformer **outperforms fine-tuned GPT-Neo (125M)** on all metrics.

**Key Insight:** For real-time, offline NPC dialogue, a compact domain-trained Transformer can outperform large general-purpose language models in task relevance, latency, and deployability.

## Explainable AI (XAI)

This project includes:
- Token-level probability inspection
- Attention heatmap visualization
- Decoder confidence analysis

These tools help interpret **why** the model generates a response — useful for research and responsible AI.

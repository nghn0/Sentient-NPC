# Sentient_NPC  
### Lightweight Offline Voice-Interactive NPC Dialogue Framework

---

## Overview

**Sentient_NPC** is a fully offline, real-time **voice-interactive NPC dialogue system** designed to enhance immersion in open-world and role-playing games.  
The framework allows players to communicate with NPCs using natural speech and receive coherent, lore-consistent spoken responses without relying on any cloud-based services.

The system integrates:
- Offline **Speech-to-Text (STT)** using Vosk  
- A **Transformer-based dialogue generation model** trained on Skyrim-style NPC–player conversations  
- Offline **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** using Silero  

This project demonstrates that **compact, domain-trained Transformer models** can outperform larger pretrained language models in low-latency, game-specific dialogue tasks.

- Real-time **voice-driven NPC interaction**
- Lightweight Transformer model (~30 MB)
- Domain-specific training for lore consistency
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Suitable for on-device and edge deployment
- Low-latency response generation
